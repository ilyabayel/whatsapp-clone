# Whatsapp Clone (This project is under development, so lots of the features I've planned have not been implemented by me yet.)

## Welcome

Hello, stranger. I'm glad you come here to see my little project.
This is clone of https://web.whatsapp.com/ that I occasionally write to improve
my software engineering skills and try some technologies, that are completely new for me.

## Quick technologies overview

To implement this project I used technologies such as:

- ReactJS (Frontend App)
- NestJS (Rest API) 
- MongoDB (Database)
- Centrifugo (Real-time messaging server)

## How to build project

To build this project, you need to have Docker (https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine. <br/>
If Docker is already installed, clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ilyakozlovdev/whatsapp-clone.git
cd whatsapp-clone
```
then start project using docker-compose
```
docker-compose up
```
and after docker finish the job go to http://localhost, that's all.
